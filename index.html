</p>

<h1>Software Features</h1>
<p>
SkiPro! is built using C++ and SFML (Super Fast Multimedia Library) for Windows platform. The game is a RPG-like, since the tiling is
used to make the background. And sprites serve for obstacles and players. The map and resources are in separate files included in the program.
Also, several SFML DLLs are included, since the SFML-code can't run without them.
Use keyboard to navigate player past the obstacles. You have 3 lives. Each hit costs you a life. Zero lives = Loss.
In future, the gameplay may be further expanded.

<h1>FAQs</h1>
<p>
<b>1. The Game won't start. What should I do?</b>
The game contains several dlls and resources (images and file text). Without them, the program won't start.
If problem occurs, try downloading the program again.

<b>2. Can I modify the files (names and content)?</b>
Please don't. The game depends on them, and any alteration to the files may cause erratic behaviour of the game.
